# RodSort
:warning: **A work in progress**

💡 An idea for a sorting algorithm that sorts one list of numbers into two sorted lists (that are not necessarily sorted when concatenated)
### For example: 
- Input: [**6**,7,**3**,4,**8**,2]
- Output: [2,4,7] and [**3**,**6**,**8**]

❓ **Analysis:**
- It has a best-case run-time of O(n)
- And a worst-case run-time of O(n²)
- It is **not** a [stable sorting algorithm](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/stability-in-sorting-algorithms/)
