# RodSort
:warning: **A work in progress**

💡 An idea for a sorting algorithm that sorts one list of numbers into two sorted lists (that are not necessarily sorted when concatenated)
### For example: 
- Input: [**4**,8,2,**6**,**9**,3]
- Output: [2,3,8] and [**4**,**6**,**9**]

❓ **Analysis:**
- It has a best-case run-time of O(n)
- And a worst-case run-time of O(n²)
